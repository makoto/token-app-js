# Balances.

## Description.

I hate taking log of my family finance. I have to login to multiple bank accounts, download and import the monthly balance to my spreadsheet, have to modify data format, and so on.

With blockchain, it doesn't have to be that way. Whether you have lots of ether or ERC20 tokens across multiple accounts, they are all in one place.

`Balances` is a companion app that allows you to keep track of multiple balances.

You can.

- Add multiple ethereum addresses.
- Display the aggregate balance of ETH (and amount in USD).
- Display the historical balance and price (in USD).

You don't have ether? Then add [these two](https://medium.com/@slacknation/vitaliks-ether-holdings-timeline-e6f5aa1dd4ea)
