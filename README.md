# Balances.

## Description.

I hate taking log of my family finance. I have to login to multiple bank accounts, download and import the monthly balance to my spreasheet, have to modify data format, and so on.

With blockchain, it doesn't have to be that way. Whether you have lots of ether or ERC20 tokens across multiple accounts, they are all in one place.

`Balances` is a companion app that allows you to keep track of multiple balances.

You can.

- Add multiple ethereum address.
- Display the aggregate balance of ether

## TODO

- Add multiple token address (or pre select from the list)
- Display the aggregate balance of tokens
- Display the aggregate balance of both token and ether
- Toggle mainnet and testnet
