## Description.

I hate taking log of my family finance. I have to login to multiple bank accounts, download and import the monthly balance to my spreadsheet, have to modify data format, and so on.

With blockchain, it doesn't have to be that way. Whether you have lots of Ether or ERC20 tokens across multiple accounts, they are all in one place.

"Balances" is a companion bot that allows you to keep track of your multiple account balances of Ethereum addresses and tokens.

You can.

- Add multiple Ethereum addresses.
- Display the aggregate balance of ETH (and the amount in USD) and Tokens (REP only for now).
- Display the historical balance and price (in USD).

You don't have Ether? Then add [these two](https://medium.com/@slacknation/vitaliks-ether-holdings-timeline-e6f5aa1dd4ea)
